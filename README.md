# Election Audit: Compiling and Reporting Election Results

## Overview of Election Audit

This project began with voting returns for Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson counties. For each ballot reported, the returns included the ballot ID, the county in which the ballot was cast, and the candidate voted for. A Python script was created to import these returns from a csv file and compile the election results as reported below.

## Election Audit Summary

The Python script prepared for this election audit can be readily adapted for use in other elections. Changes to names of counties and slates of candidates require no modifications to the script. More detailed results can be created by (1) compiling and reporting vote totals for each candidate in each county, and (2) compiling and reporting the percentage of the vote for each candidate in each county.
